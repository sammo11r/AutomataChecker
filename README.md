# AutomataChecker
Automata checker is, as the name suggest, a tool used to check automata. In particular, it can be used to check the correctness of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) against a set of input words. This tool was developed whilst following the course Automata Theory and Language Complexity at Eindhoven University of Technology, and is hence designed to be used in a learning environment.
